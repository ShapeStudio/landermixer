# landermixer

**Deep prospect research from any LinkedIn URL — and prospect search from your own company URL. Structured JSON out.**

One command runs a research agent that works through up to 13 targeted web searches — the person, their company, its global and home-market competitors, funding, news, hiring, traffic, pricing — and returns a single validated JSON dossier you can pipe anywhere. Don't have a prospect list yet? [`landermixer search`](#prospect-search) starts from your own website and finds one.

## Install & use

```bash
# one-off
npx landermixer <linkedin-url>

# or install
npm i -g landermixer
landermixer <linkedin-url> --pretty
```

**Single prospect**

```bash
landermixer https://linkedin.com/in/jane-doe --company-url https://acme.com
landermixer https://linkedin.com/in/jane-doe --json | jq '.outreach.hooks'
landermixer https://linkedin.com/in/jane-doe --depth deep --out jane.json
```

**Batch (CSV)**

```bash
landermixer --csv prospects.csv --out results/ --concurrency 3
```

The CSV needs a `linkedin_url` column; `company_url`, `name`, `company`, `notes` are optional ([example](examples/prospects.example.csv)). One JSON file per prospect lands in `--out`; a bad row never aborts the batch (exit code `3` signals partial failure).

JSON goes to **stdout**, progress to **stderr** — pipe-safe by design.

## Prospect search

No list yet? Point `landermixer search` at **your own website**. It reads what you sell, commits to an ICP (ideal customer profile — industries, company sizes, geographies, buyer titles), then hunts for matching decision-makers at other companies across team pages, conference agendas, news, and public profile snippets.

```bash
landermixer search https://www.your-company.com --pretty
landermixer search https://acme.dev --target "Heads of RevOps at Series A-B SaaS in DACH"
landermixer search https://acme.dev --count 8 --research --out prospects/
```

```jsonc
{
  "icp": {
    "what_they_sell": "…grounded in your actual site, so you can sanity-check the inference…",
    "buyer_titles": ["Founder / CEO", "CTO", "VP of Product"],
    "target_industries": ["B2B SaaS", "E-commerce & retail"],
    "icp_source": "inferred"          // "provided" when you pass --target
    // … category, target_company_size, target_geographies, buying_triggers
  },
  "prospects": [
    {
      "full_name": "…", "title": "…", "company": "…",
      "linkedin_url": "…",            // ONLY when the URL actually appeared in a
                                      // search result — never constructed from a name
      "why_relevant": "…ties back to the icp block…",
      "source_url": "…",              // required: the page where name + role were seen
      "signals": ["…funding, hiring, launches — reasons to reach out now…"],
      "confidence": "high"            // high | medium | low, criteria in the docs
    }
  ],
  "meta": { "sources": [{ "label": "…", "url": "…" }], "searches_used": 14, "schema_version": "1" }
}
```

- `--target` skips ICP inference and adopts your own description — the sharpest results come from one good sentence about who you sell to.
- `--research` chains every prospect that has a verified `linkedin.com/in` URL straight into the full research pipeline: with `--out <dir>` you get `search.json` plus one dossier file per prospect; without it, one combined JSON envelope on stdout. Prospects without an observed URL are skipped and reported, never guessed.
- Fewer results than `--count` is intentional honesty: every listed person must be citable via `source_url`.

The sample fixture [`examples/sample-search-output.json`](examples/sample-search-output.json) has a **real ICP inference** for our own site, but the prospect entries are **fictionalized** (invented people and `.example` domains) — we don't publish real third-party people in a git repo. Run it on your own site to see the real thing.

## Library

```ts
import { research, researchMany, prospectResearchSchema } from "landermixer";

const dossier = await research(
  { linkedin_url: "https://linkedin.com/in/jane-doe", company_url: "https://acme.com" },
  { depth: "standard", onProgress: (e) => console.error(e) },
);
// dossier is fully typed (ProspectResearch) and already validated
```

`researchMany(inputs, { concurrency })` runs a bounded pool with per-row error isolation. The zod schemas (`prospectResearchSchema`, `researchInputSchema`, `prospectSearchSchema`, `searchInputSchema`) are exported — validate stored dossiers, generate types, build on top.

Search-then-research is a two-liner:

```ts
import { searchProspects, researchMany } from "landermixer";

const found = await searchProspects({ company_url: "https://acme.com", count: 10 });
const dossiers = await researchMany(
  found.prospects
    .filter((p) => p.linkedin_url)
    .map((p) => ({ linkedin_url: p.linkedin_url!, name: p.full_name, company: p.company })),
  { concurrency: 3 },
);
```

## Keys & cost

| Key | Required | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | yes | Runs the research agent (Claude + web search). [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| `PROXYCURL_API_KEY` | no | Verified LinkedIn profile data — rescues member-gated profiles. [nubela.co/proxycurl](https://nubela.co/proxycurl) |

Keys load from env vars or a `.env` in the working directory. **Approximate cost per prospect** (you pay your providers directly, we take nothing):

| Command | Depth | Web searches | Typical cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| research | `standard` | up to 13 | ~$0.30–0.45 |
| research | `deep` | up to 17 | ~$0.50–0.60 |
| search | `standard` | up to 14 | ~$0.40–0.60 |
| search | `deep` | up to 18 | ~$0.65–0.90 |

Made of: Anthropic tokens, web-search fees ($0.01/search), optional Proxycurl (~$0.01, research only). Runs also make a few direct page fetches (your site, team pages) — fetches have no per-use fee; the fetched content bills as normal input tokens.

## How it sources data

The agent uses **public web search and direct page fetches** (plus Proxycurl's API if you provide a key). Any URL you provide — your own site in `search`, `--company-url` in research — is **fetched directly**, so it grounds the research even when the site isn't indexed by any search engine. It does not log into LinkedIn, does not scrape behind auth walls, and marks everything unverifiable as an estimate with its basis — or leaves it empty. `meta.sources` lists every page that informed the dossier; `meta.confidence` and `meta.research_notes` tell you how much to trust it. In prospect search, LinkedIn profile URLs are included **only when they actually appeared in retrieved results** — never constructed from a name — and every prospect carries the `source_url` where their name and role were seen.

## Schema stability

The output shape is versioned via `meta.schema_version` (currently `"1"`). Breaking shape changes bump it alongside a major package release.
